Contribution, Development, and Coding Conventions

Please adhere to the following contribution conventions to promote a healthy work ethic, and to avoid any confusion or coding conflicts.

The Tipsy Lead Developer requests that;
* All contributors use a Git shell to commit/push changes to source
* All contributors request an SSH key for performing Git actions
* All contributors adhere to the following commit/push notification format for every alteration made

    ```md
    <Username of editor> has commited and pushed changes to;
    <file edited> in location
    <./file(s)/location ( & /location-2 & /location-3)>

    Please fetch/pull changes before attempting to alter local copies
    ```
* The latter message will be posted in the applicable Discord channel for each commit/push
* All contributors will communicate within the applicable Discord channel before making changes, in order to avoid confusion and/or coding conflicts

More conventions will be added. This is not the final copy of these conventions.
